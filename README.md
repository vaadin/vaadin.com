# vaadin.com website public tracker

This is a public issue tracker for the [vaadin.com](https://vaadin.com/) website. 
It will be used to announce major changes, forecast what we are working on.

## What is this repository for?

If there are major changes on the website we will announce them here.

:+1: If you are having issues with the vaadin.com website — you cannot log in, [forum](https://vaadin.com/forum) is slow, or there is an issue with [Vaadin Directory](https://vaadin.com/directory) — **please open an
issue here**. If your topic is sensitive you can  still contact us at [via web form]
support](https://vaadin.com/company/contact).

:+1: If you want a new feature in vaadin.com — new information about something, new documentation, or new way to log in
 — **please open an issue here**. We will take the feature under
consideration: keep in mind, we often have to pass on really good ideas due to
time constraints. Wherever we can, we'll try to make your feature possible.

:-1: This repository is **not** the place for technical support and help with Vaadin products. For  that kind of discussion [vaadin.com/forum](https://vaadin.com/forum) or our [expert chat service](https://vaadin.com/support) is better option.

:-1: This repository is **not** the place to report issues in Vaadin products other than website. Please use the dedicated [GitHub product repositories for that](https://github.com/vaadin).
